            The nightingale, rufous nightingale or simply nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos),
            is a small passerine bird best known for its powerful and beautiful song. It was 
            formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally
            considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae.[2] It belongs to a group of 
            terrestrial species, often called chats.
