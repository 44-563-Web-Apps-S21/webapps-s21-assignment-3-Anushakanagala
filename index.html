   <h4>
       Favourite Activity - Swimming
   </h4>

   <p>
        
    If you were to ask me what my favourite sport is, my answer would be swimming. 
    I started learning how to swim when I was five years old and I have been swimming ever since.
    There are many reasons why I love swimming but I’ll just share a few with you, 
    and maybe I can even encourage you to go for a swim.The first reason that I love <b>swimming is that 
    it can be extremely relaxing</b> . I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost
    weightless. I find that whenever I leave the pool I feel totally relaxed.On the other hand, it can
    also be a <b>fast-paced competitive sport which raises your heartbeat</b>. It’s amazing pushing yourself
    to the challenge of beating someone else to the finish line and it’s great fun racing across the 
    pool as fast as you can! Trying little tricks like underwater handstands and flips also puts a big 
    smile on my face.Another reason that I love swimming is that it has more variety than other sports.
    Swimming offers many different strokes, so it doesn’t feel like you’re stuck doing the same 
    thing over and over again. Adding swimming equipment like flippers, a snorkel or a noodle 
    (a flexible cylindrical piece of foam) changes the experience yet again and can help you develop
    your swimming technique.
